3. Name it (e.g., "YouTube Uploader") and click **Create**

### Step 2: Enable YouTube Data API

1. In your project, go to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
2. Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
3. Click on it and press **Enable**

### Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

## File Structure

```
.
├── run.sh                  # Build and run script
├── Dockerfile              # Container definition
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── youtube_downloader.py   # Main CLI application
├── client_secrets.json     # Your OAuth credentials (not in git)
├── credentials/            # Saved auth tokens (not in git)
└── downloads/              # Downloaded/stitched videos (not in git)
```

## Google Cloud Storage Backup Setup

To enable backing up videos to Google Cloud Storage:

### Step 1: Enable Cloud Storage API

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (same one used for YouTube)
3. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
4. Search for "Cloud Storage" or "Google Cloud Storage JSON API"
5. Click **Enable**

### Step 2: Create a Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Cloud Storage** → **Buckets**
2. Click **Create Bucket**
3. Choose a unique name (e.g., `my-ytd-backups`)
4. Select a region close to you
5. Leave other settings as default and click **Create**

### Step 3: First Backup

1. Run `./run.sh` and type `backup`
2. You'll be prompted to authenticate (similar to YouTube)
3. Enter your bucket name when prompted
4. Select videos to backup

Files are stored in `gs://your-bucket/ytd-backups/`

## Notes

- Videos are saved to `./downloads/` on your host machine
- The first time you upload, you'll need to authenticate via browser
- After authentication, tokens are saved and reused
- Your `client_secrets.json` is mounted read-only for security
- If you get authentication errors, run `auth` to re-authenticate

## Privacy Settings

When uploading, you can choose:
- **private** (default) - Only you can view
- **unlisted** - Anyone with the link can view
- **public** - Anyone can find and view

## Requirements

- nerdctl (or Docker)
- A Google account for YouTube uploads and Cloud Storage
